                            Currently working as a Junior Web Developer at Proditech Solutions in Mumbai, where I assist 
                            in developing and maintaining responsive websites using modern web technologies. I optimize 
                            front-end performance and collaborate with design and backend teams to ensure seamless delivery 
                            of digital experiences.

                            My technical foundation spans across multiple domains - from front-end technologies like HTML5, 
                            CSS3, JavaScript, and React.js to backend development with Java, PHP, and database management 
                            using MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I've successfully integrated dynamic features using 
                            Google APIs including Maps, Calendar, and Drive.

                            I've built impactful applications including an ML-based sales forecasting tool with over 90% 
                            prediction accuracy, a student result management system that reduced processing time by 50%, 
                            and a sorting algorithm visualizer that helped 100+ students understand complex concepts during 
                            college workshops.
